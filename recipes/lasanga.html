    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This healthy vegetarian spinach lasagna includes lots of fresh spinach, jarred artichokes and the simplest homemade tomato sauce. This lasagna tastes even better the next day! Recipe yields one 9-inch square lasagna, which is enough for 8 to 9 servings.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Spinach Artichoke Mixture</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups (16 ounces) low fat cottage cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped red onion (about 1 smallish red onion)</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, pressed or minced</li>
            <li>1 cup jarred or defrosted frozen artichokes, drained (simply omit for a classic spinach lasagna), quartered if necessary</li>
            <li>12 ounces baby spinach, preferably organic</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse out the food processor and return it to the machine. Pour half of the cottage cheese (1 cup) into the processor and blend it until smooth, about 1 minute. Transfer the mixture to large mixing bowl. No need to rinse out the bowl of the food processor this time; just put it back onto the machine because you’ll need it later.</li>
        <li>Warm 2 tablespoons olive oil a large skillet over medium heat. Once the oil is shimmering, add the chopped onion and ¼ teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring often, until the onion is tender and translucent, about 4 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>

        <li>Add the artichoke to the skillet, then add a few large handfuls of spinach. Cook, stirring and tossing frequently, until the spinach has wilted. Repeat with remaining spinach. Continue cooking for about 12 minutes, stirring frequently, until the spinach has dramatically reduced in volume and very little moisture remains in the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Transfer the spinach artichoke mixture to the bowl of the food processor and pulse until the contents are finely chopped (but not puréed!), about 12 to 15 times. Transfer the mixture to the bowl of whipped cottage cheese. Top with remaining cottage cheese and mix well. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Now it’s lasagna assembly time!</li>
